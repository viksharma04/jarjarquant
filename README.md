## About

Jarjarquant is a package that implements common techniques in advanced financial machine learning. A big inspiration is the techniques discussed in [*Advances in Financial Machine Learning* by Marcos López de Prado](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Advances+in+Financial+Machine+Learning-p-9781119482086).

One of the concepts discussed in *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* is the strategy production chain:
